## Quickstart
the library provides different scopes of information

### Father Objects
a set of classes that represent biblical fathers, such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

```
from hi_humans import hebrews


abraham = hebrews.Abraham()
print(abraham.__dict__)
```
### List of Humans
on a broader scope, the library traces different categories of humans, such as fathers, mothers and children.
```
from hi_humans import hebrews

heb_mothers = hebrews.mothers
print(heb_mothers)
```
